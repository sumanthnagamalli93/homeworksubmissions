		<h3>Kate Middleton Is the Ultimate Wardrobe-Repeater on Christmas Day</h3>
		<p>While many of us were shuffling around in sweats on Christmas morning, the British royal family were busy preparing for their annual procession to church service. And one figure who stood out on the historic walk in Bucklebury, Berkshire, was Kate Middleton. Spotted with her husband Prince William and kids Prince George and Princess Charlotte yesterday, Middleton looked elegant in a coat from the British high street brand, Hobbs.

Middleton has had the oxblood red piece in her closet for quite some time now. In fact she was seen wearing the coat on Valentine’s Day back in 2012, and then again with a ruby red pashmina on Christmas of the same year. The Duchess put a luxe spin on the style via a fur collar for the coat’s most recent outing. Coordinating tassel-trimmed heeled loafers from Tod’s added a ladylike polish to the ensemble. The rest of the family looked just as stylish—Princess Charlotte was particularly adorable in a tonal dress and tights. Which begs the question: Will there be a royal mommy-daughter twinning moment before the year is out?</p>

		<h3>Fall’s Best Boots for Under $500</h3>
		<p>Click through Fall’s biggest trends and you’ll notice that many of them are textures. Brocade, patent leather, shearling, and velvet lent a sense of richness to the collections that we saw in February and March, from Erdem’s glinty floral gowns to Chloé’s shearling jackets. Those items are trickling into stores now, but if you aren’t quite ready to invest—the leaves are just starting to turn, after all—you can still dip a toe in the trend (quite literally) with beautifully textured boots. If you loved the silvery dresses at Marc Jacobs and Michael Kors Collection, for instance, a chrome Chelsea boot would upgrade your plain sweaters and jeans. Old-world interiors—like Brock Collection’s coatdresses and Gucci’s suits—more your speed? Brocade ankle boots are destined to be your new go-to.

The Spring ’17 shows just wrapped in Paris and the word on the street is all about bright colors and prints. Minimalism might officially be dead—so why go back to your boring black boots? We found 22 of-the-minute styles to shop now in the slideshow, all for under $500—so you can keep saving up for a puffer to wear with them.</p>

		<h3>What’s Better Than Chocolate? Healthy Chocolate—From Kale Bars to Goji-Maca Truffles</h3>
		<p>Chocolate may not be as guilty a pleasure as it used to be, thanks to the rise of high-quality craft brands, but the latest wave of truffles and bars reflect 2016’s mania for all things wellness-related. Packing megadoses of antioxidants, omega-3s, and even extra fiber, these aren’t your childhood holiday candy. “The ingredients in chocolate help to fight free radicals, preventing signs of aging,” says nutritionist and self-proclaimed “chocoholic” Jessica Katz, R.D. When searching for the right treat, she advises, “look for a product that’s low in sugar and is created with as few ingredients as possible.” Aloha’s soy-free, vegan, and non-GMO Tropical Twist bar, for instance, is formulated with mango and pineapple for a touch of sweetness without the blood-sugar spike.</p>

		<h3>The Best Art Shows of 2016</h3>
		<p>After this roller coaster ride of an election year, it’s hard to know where to begin but art–and what artists have to say–is something we need more than ever right now. Artists are fearless. They see things in ways mere mortals can’t, and they speak and reveal a kind of truth, one that can heal as well as burn, that others wouldn’t dare to say. Despite all the political noise in 2016, there were some standout shows.</p>

		<h3>A Look Back at the Obamas’ Most Memorable Trips</h3>
		<p>President Obama will soon be enjoying a long, well-deserved vacation. It could last months, and may, as the president has joked, involve two weeks of solid sleep. After all, the president’s trips these past few years have been anything but restful. During his presidency, he’s visited more than 50 countries on official state business. Most recently, this included a voyage to Peru after the election (his final international trip while in office). But even considering the occasion, the tour had its fair share of competition when it came to his most momentous and memorable trips.

In 2011, the president and first lady visited Buckingham Palace, where they dined with the Queen. More recently, the first couple stayed at Kensington Palace, where they gifted Prince George a rocking horse (Prince William and Kate Middleton were of course there, too). President Obama has also traveled to the Vatican (where he met with the pope), Indonesia (where he spent time growing up), and Afghanistan (to surprise American troops). More memorably still, he dined with Anthony Bourdain in Hanoi, Vietnam, for an episode of Bourdain’s show Parts Unknown. And he always has an eye peeled while abroad for any opportunity to visit an iconic spot. (He’s made it to Stonehenge, the Pyramids of Giza, the Great Wall of China, and Petra—just to name a few.)</p>
